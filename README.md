Facebook Marketplace Bot that Automatically Lowballs People 

## What do you need to use?
A Facebook Account
Chromium to use Pyppetteer

1b. Make sure you have a chromium instance installed in your repo install and route it correctly through utils (Chromedriver download through pip install pyppetteer never works for me.)

2. Since we're using a headless browser, you'll need to input your Username and Password for Facebook into the utils file to pass certain bot restrictions from using pyppetteer
3.
